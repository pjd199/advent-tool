# Advent of Code Tool

This tool follows the
[automation guidelines](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/wiki/faqs/automation)
on the /r/adventofcode community wiki.

Specifically:

- Outbound calls are throttled to every x minutes in TBC
- Once inputs are downloaded, they are cached locally (TBC) If you suspect your
  input is corrupted, you can manually request a fresh copy using TBC
- The User-Agent header in TBC is set to me since I maintain this tool
